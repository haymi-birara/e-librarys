# The E-Library Management System is a software application developed using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL. The system helps schools, colleges, and organizations manage their library activities in an easy and organized way.

This application allows Admins and Users to log in and perform different tasks based on their roles.
Admins can manage books, users, borrowing records, and reports.
Users can search for books, borrow books, and view their borrowing history.

The system includes features such as adding books with cover images, editing and deleting books, viewing available and borrowed books, recording borrow/return actions, and generating useful reports. It also has a clean and user-friendly interface built with JavaFX and FXML.

In short, this project provides a complete digital library solution that makes library management simple, fast, and efficient.
